####################  Data source ########################:	
Date of travel
StartTime: when getting into the car
DayOfWeek: the day name
GoingTo: direction of travel
Distance travelled in kilometers
MaxSpeed: fastest speed recorded (all trips are on the 407 highway for some portion)
AvgSpeed: the average speed for the entire trip
AvgMovingSpeed: the average speed recorded only while the car is moving
FuelEconomy: a rough estimate of fuel economy (it is inaccurate)
TotalTime: duration of the entire trip, in minutes
MovingTime: duration when the car was considered to be moving (i.e. not counting traffic delays, accidents, or time while the car is stationary)
Take407All: is Yes if the 407 toll highway was taken for the entire trip. 
I try to avoid taking the 407, taking slower back routes to save costs. 
But some days I'm running late, or just lazy, and take it all the way.
